### Hi there, I'm Samuel ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy writing codes and thinking about the next "solution" to get my hands on. 

âš¡ Lately I've been using ReactJS, NextJS, React Native, Node.JS, Express.JS, Redux, Redux Toolkit, React Query, and several other techs to build web and mobile apps. 

âš¡ I am happy to connect with you.
